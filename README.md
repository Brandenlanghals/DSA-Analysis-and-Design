# CS-300 DSA Analysis and Design
- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The overall objective in this course was to learn new data structures and how they can be used differently to interpret data. We observed Vectors, Hash     Tables, and Binary Search Trees to pull data from a CSV file and parse the data using the various data structures. Each structure has strengths and         weaknesses, and depending on what the projects requirements are, can be appropriate to implement. 
  
- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
