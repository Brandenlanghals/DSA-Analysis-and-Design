# CS-300 DSA Analysis and Design
- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  The overall objective in this course was to learn new data structures and how they can be used differently to interpret data. We observed Vectors, Hash     Tables, and Binary Search Trees to pull data from a CSV file and parse the data using the various data structures. Each structure has strengths and         weaknesses, and depending on what the requirements of the project are, can be appropriate to implement. 
  
- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  The requirements for the final project were that we needed to be able to create a list of courses and sort them alphanumerically. We also needed to find   necessary prerequisites and add them to the course object. Different data structures will handle this effectively and I decided that using a binary         search tree was the most effective way of doing so. Considering the size of the data file that we needed to use for this project, the other options         would have worked fine. But a BST would be best for scalability, allowing us to add more data while still achieving our goals. 
  
- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  My main method for overcoming roadblocks was to take a break. When I am hyperfocused on a certain aspect of code or course materials I tend to forget to   look for a fresh perspective. Coming back to work with a new mindset often opens up the floodgates and solutions come to me quickly. When this doesn't     work, I scan places like Zybooks, StackOverflow, and Github for inspiration to move forward. 
  
- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  Considering the best way to implement a program based on its data usage is not something I have spent a lot of time focused on. This consideration will     weigh heavily in my approach to future projects. Rather than taking the approach of just "making it work" I would like to focus on making it work well. 
  
- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I have always tried to keep my code clean and organized. This class has given me a bit more insight as to the linear structure of where each piece         belongs and how it makes sense to pull data, parse it, and populate it where necessary.
