# CS-300 DSA Analysis and Design
- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- The overall objective in this course was to learn new data structures and how they can be used differently to interpret data. We observed Vectors, Hash     Tables, and Binary Search Trees to pull data from a CSV file and parse the data using the various data structures. Each structure has strengths and         weaknesses, and depending on what the projects requirements are, can be appropriate to implement. 
  
- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- The requirements for the final project were that we needed to be able to create a list of courses and sort them alphanumerically. We also needed to find necessary prerequisites and add them to the course object. Different data structures will handle this effectively and I decided that using a binary search tree was the most effective way of doing so. Considering the size of the data file that we needed to use for this project, the other options would have worked fine. But a BST would be best for scalability and allowing us to add more data and still achieving our goals.
